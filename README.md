| # | Title | Solution | Comments |
|---| ----- | -------- | --------------------- |
| 1 | [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) | [C++](./solutions/TwoSum/solution.cpp) | hash map, two pointers. Note that this is a special case (exactly one solution exists). So hash map works fine. In a general case sort + two pointers would work.  |
| 2 | [Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/) | [C++](./solutions/AddTwoNumbers/solution.cpp)| classic linked list |
| 28 | [Implement strStr()](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr/) | [C](./solutions/ImplementStrStr/solution.c)| check if s1 is a substring of s2 |
| 33 | [Search In Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/) | [C++](./solutions/SearchInRotatedSortedArray/solution.cpp)| binary search |

| 213 | [House Robber II](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/) | [Python](./solutions/HouseRobberII/solution.py)| like a classic house robber but houses arranged in circle |
| 226 | [Invert Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/) | [C++](./solutions/InvertBinaryTree/solution.cpp)| |
| 297 | [Serialize And Deserialize Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/) | [Python](./solutions/SerializeAndDeserializeBinaryTree/solution.py) [C++](./solutions/SerializeAndDeserializeBinaryTree/solution.cpp) | pre-order traversal works, not sure about formal proof, easy to see that post and in-order traversals not up to the task  |
| 300 | [Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/ ) | [C++](./solutions/LongestIncreasingSubsequence/solution.cpp) [Python](./solutions/LongestIncreasingSubsequence/solution.py)| C++ solution easy dp in O(N^2), Python a bit tricky in O(NlnN), matma |
