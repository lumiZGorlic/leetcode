## Problems & Solutions

| # | Title | Solution | Comments |
|---| ----- | -------- | --------------------- |
| 1 | [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) | [C++](./solutions/TwoSum/solution.cpp) | hash map, two pointers. Note that this is a special case (exactly one solution exists). So hash map works fine. In a general case sort + two pointers would work.  |
| 2 | [Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/) | [C++](./solutions/AddTwoNumbers/solution.cpp)| classic linked list |
| 33 | [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/) | [C++](./solutions/SearchInRotatedSortedArray/solution.cpp)| binary search |
| 50 | [Pow(x,n)](https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/) | [Python](./solutions/PowXn/solution.py)  |  |
| 62 | [Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/) | [C++](./solutions/UniquePaths/solution.cpp)| dp |
| 63 | [Unique Paths II](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/) | [C++](./solutions/UniquePathsII/solution.cpp)| dp |
| 139 | [Word Break](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/) | [C++](./solutions/WordBreak/solution.cpp) | dp |
| 140 | [Word Break II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break-ii/) | [Python](./solutions/WordBreakII/solution.py) | dp |
| 146 | [LRU Cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/) | [C++](./solutions/LRUCache/solution.cpp)| |
| 169 | [Majority Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/) | [C++](./solutions/MajorityElement/solution.cpp)| Boyerâ€“Moore majority vote algorithm |
| 226 | [Invert Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/) | [C++](./solutions/InvertBinaryTree/solution.cpp)| |
| 297 | [Serialize And Deserialize Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/) | [Python](./solutions/SerializeAndDeserializeBinaryTree/solution.py) [C++](./solutions/SerializeAndDeserializeBinaryTree/solution.cpp) | pre-order traversal works, not sure about formal proof, easy to see that post and in-order traversals not up to the task  |
| 445 | [Add Two Numbers II](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers-ii/) | [C++](./solutions/AddTwoNumbersII/solution.cpp)| reverse linked list |
| 877 | [Stone Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game/) | [C++](./solutions/StoneGame/solution.cpp)| dp |
| 1937 | [Maximum Number Of Points With Cost](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-points-with-cost/) | [C++](./solutions/MaximumNumberOfPointsWithCost/solution.cpp)| dp |
