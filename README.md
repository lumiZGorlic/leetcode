## Problems & Solutions

| # | Title | Solution | Comments |
|---| ----- | -------- | --------------------- |
| 1 | [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) | [C++](./solutions/TwoSum/solution.cpp) | hash map, two pointers. Note that this is a special case (exactly one solution exists). So hash map works fine. In a general case sort + two pointers would work.  |
| 50 | [Pow(x,n)](https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/) | [Python](./solutions/powXn/solution.py)  |  |
| 139 | [Word Break](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break/) | [Python](./solutions/WordBreak/solution.cpp) | dp |
| 140 | [Word Break II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-break-ii/) | [Python](./solutions/WordBreakII/solution.py) | dp |
| 297 | [Serialize And Deserialize Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/) | [Python](./solutions/SerializeAndDeserializeBinaryTree/solution.py) [C++](./solutions/SerializeAndDeserializeBinaryTree/solutions.cpp) | pre-order traversal works, not sure about formal proof, easy to see that post and in-order traversals not up to the task  |
